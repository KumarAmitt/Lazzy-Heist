# Lazzy-Heist

Lazzy Heist is a Web Scraper build in Ruby. It scraps data for Movies and TV Shows listed under different categories from
the IMDb webs

Data Scraping is one of the way to extract desired data from a website. The information is collected and then exported into a format that is more useful for the users.
